Cinderella was a Disney princess from the Disney movie "Cinderella," in which she is the princess. I've always wanted to know what she'd look like if she was a guy named Steve -- and now we know:

### 2 - BELLE

Remember Belle? She was a princess in a Disney movie -- well she married a prince at the end so she BECOMES a princess by virtue of marriage like our very own Disney Meghan Markle -- so you love her more than life itself, right? Well prepare to have your MIND BLOW when you see her as a Steve!!

Ariel (whose father is King Triton, so she's definitely a princess!), has her dream come true when she becomes part of Steve's world!

### 4 - MULAN

Mulan wasn't literally a princess in the movie "Mulan," I mean she flirts with a general guy at the end but even if she married him she still wouldn't technically be a princess. BUT SHE'S STILL A DISNEY PRINCESS BECAUSE WE SAY SO AND WE LOVE HER.

### 5 - JASMINE

Now, see, Jasmine actually is a princess, technically, because her dad is the Sultan. But she looks AMAZING as a guy name Steve! Wow!

### 7 - SNOW WHITE

Snow White was the first Disney princess so some would say that she is the BEST Disney princess. But that would BE DUMB BECAUSE EVERY DISNEY PRINCESS IS THE BEST DISNEY PRINCESS.

### 8 - ELSA FROM FROZEN

I know I said that every princess is the best princess but we all know thats not technically true because the BEST PRINCESS IS ELSA FROM FROZEN AND YOU CAN NEVER SAY ELSA YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO SAY ELSA FROM FROZEN. ELSA FROM FROZEN SINGS THE SONG AND YOU LOVE HER. YOU LOVE HER AND YOU WOULD DIE FOR HER IN A SECOND!!

Here she is as a guy named Steve:
