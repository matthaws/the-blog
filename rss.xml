It makes me feel like I can point my thoughts at the screen like a magic wand and presto an app into existence. I mean, not really. There’s tons of debugging and tinkering, and obviously nothing is perfect, but it somehow still &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like magic even after working with it on so many projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many developers aren’t comfortable with “magic” — that is to say, with code that’s just doing things for you that you don’t know about or fully understand. Personally, I love magic. The less brainpower I’m devoting to smaller details, the more attention I can put to the bigger ones, the ones that matter, the ones that lead to clever implementations and rich user experiences. But I agree that magic shouldn’t necessarily be trusted implicitly, and a developer looking to gain full mastery over their toolset should open the hood to see what’s really going on under there. That’s why I built my own backend framework and ORM based on Rails a few months back. And its also why I’ve been reading a lot about React’s internal plumbing and putting together my own modest version that I have oh-so-cleverly called &lt;em&gt;Weact&lt;/em&gt;. Because with it, &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; can &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt;, get it? Actually, mostly because it just sounds like React said by Homestar Runner and that makes me happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virtual DOM reconciliation algorithm was hands down the most interesting part of building Weact — basically a big recursive function comparing two data trees and making changes to the DOM as necessary. However, React has gone through a lot of internal restructuring as of version 16 which completely changes the way it works through reconciliation and updating the DOM. It accomplishes this via the implementation of a new workflow using “fibers”. It’s completely fascinating and incredibly clever! I’m indebted to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture&quot;&gt;Andrew Clark’s thorough “React Fiber Architecture”&lt;/a&gt; for wrapping my head around the high-level concept. He works at Facebook and is a co-creator of Redux so you know he knows what he’s talking about. I recommend you check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, it turns out that the most expensive, time-consuming part of a React re-render is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, as many of us might have once assumed, the actual changes to the DOM. Instead, its the reconciliation process of comparing the virtual DOM to the real one that takes up the most time. This actually made a lot of sense once it was laid out for me and once I had written a version of that reconciliation algorithm myself. It’s a recursive function traveling down potentially the entire DOM tree, which, in a large app with many nodes, could mean a lot of work, even with React’s under-the-hood optimizations to reduce unnecessary comparisons. During each re-render, Javascript’s single thread is stuck working through the full reconciliation until its completely finished. This was causing problems as React has grown across platforms and into wider use cases such as animation where blocking the main thread causes noticeable performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the “fiber” - essentially, a record of one unit of work in the greater process of reconciling and updating the DOM. By breaking up the work into these bite-sized chunks, we are able to queue them and process them whenever we want rather than being stuck doing all the work all at once. This means that, with fibers, React can stop in the middle of a re-render to address other important work, pause re-rendering until we have the data we want (the upcoming React Suspense feature will give an API for exactly that), and process the workflow in order of priority. And anything on the DOM during re-render is still inter-actable! We have a lot more flexibility in how the work actually gets done and when. A fiber is just a plain old Javascript object with all the details related to that unit of work. These objects can be queued up and processed as the browser has time for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was immediately interested in updating my humble Weact to give it an an incremental rendering / time-slicing reconciliation algorithm inspired by the new React 16 architecture, even if there was no way I’d be able to mimic all its features or efficiency exactly. I understood what was happening with fibers at a high level but needed help getting started with implementation details. I am highly indebted to &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.hexacta.com/didact-fiber-incremental-reconciliation-b2fe028dcaec&quot;&gt;Rodrigo Pombo’s “Build Your Own React”&lt;/a&gt; series of posts in which he walks through his interpretation of a simple Fiber-based reconciliation process. It was hugely helpful in getting started, but I knew I wanted to go further; his guide is very narrowly focused so it doesn’t include component lifecycle methods or even functional components, both features I really wanted to implement in Weact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three major phases to the new reconciliation process of Weact - 1) traversing the tree to get the next node/fiber to queue up, 2) processing that fiber to figure out what the new DOM should look like at that node, and 3) committing our work by actually updating the DOM. The core of the process that keeps everything going is a global object that keeps track of three things: a queue of nodes waiting to be processed, the next fiber to process to compare actual changes (this is set to each node one at a time as they dequeue), and a pendingCommit if we are ready to go ahead and start the changes to the DOM itself. The &lt;code&gt;nextFiber&lt;/code&gt; can be processed or changes in the queue can be shifted off and implemented whenever the thread is idle using the browser’s &lt;code&gt;requestIdleCallback()&lt;/code&gt; — if something urgent comes along that needs to be processed, the whole workflow can just chill and wait for everything to clear before being processed again. The global object starts off very simple, but will be the master overseer of the whole process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; globalQueue &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  updateQueue&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  nextFiber&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  pendingCommit&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways the rendering process can be kicked off, either a call to &lt;code&gt;Weact.render&lt;/code&gt;, which is likely just rendering the parent component to the app, or from a component’s &lt;code&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt;. In either case, we’re going to enqueue an object with a reference to the element in question (the literal dom node we are hooking into with &lt;code&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; or the instance of the Weact class that called &lt;code&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt;) along with some extra info including any children, the new state, and where this change is starting from (HOST or CLASS). Our algorithm will dequeue the change and get started by comparing the the old DOM tree with what it should look like now. It does this (and this is a very clever bit, full credit to Pombo for this) by &lt;em&gt;descending&lt;/em&gt; the tree from the root node until it reaches a leave, a node with no parent, where it then compares what is currently on the DOM with what it should look like after the new props are applied. Changes get added to the global queue
with references to the node in question (before and after change) and a &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; of change: UPDATE, DELETION, or PLACEMENT. Then it moves on to any siblings and does the same by updating ‘nextFiber’. Once done with siblings or if there weren’t any, it moves back up to the parent and process that node, and then any its siblings. But the process always starts with children, calling &lt;code&gt;reconcileChildArray&lt;/code&gt; so that we will definitely get to every leaf in the tree — we’re also using this to slowly collect shorthand for all the DOM changes by having them “trickle up” from child to parent until they reach the root. Eventually this process will get to every part of the tree and make it all the way back up to the root node with all the changes required queued up and ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to recongize that this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; happening in one big recursive call like it was in my first version of Weact. Each step of this process is done simply by processing one &lt;code&gt;nextFiber&lt;/code&gt; at at time with specific data and queuing up nodes to be processed in the &lt;code&gt;updateQueue&lt;/code&gt; accordingly. This means that at any time in this process the browser can stop to do other work before continuing processing the queue. It’s super clever and I can in no way take credit for coming up with the concept — implementing it was fun enough challenge for me as it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part I wanted to add to all this, however, were lifecycle functions. How do those fit in to this new process? If there’s not current an instance of the appropriate class on the DOM in the node whose fiber we are currently processing, we know its about to be mounted. Therefore, all the mounting lifecycle methods should happen before we finalize what the new node should look like, run render on that instance, and then reconcile the changes with what we had before. I abstracted this work into a function I called &lt;code&gt;componentMountingPhase&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;componentMountingPhase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;instance&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; fiber&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  instance&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;componentWillMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; newChildElements &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; instance&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  instance&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;reconcileChildArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fiber&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; newChildElements&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, if there is already an instance of this class at the same position in the tree, we know we are doing an update/re-render. We need to apply those lifecycle methods here as appropriate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;instance&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;componentWillReceiveProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;prevProps&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; nextProps&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;instance&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;nextProps&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; nextState&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  instance&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;componentWillUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;nextProps&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; nextState&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  instance&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;props &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; fiber&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;props
  instance&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;state &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; nextState
  fiber&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;newStateStuff &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; newChildElements &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; fiber&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;stateNode&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  instance&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;componentDidUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;prevProps&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; prevState&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;reconcileChildArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fiber&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; newChildElements&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cloneChildFibers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fiber&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/code&gt; returns a false-y value, we’ll simply clone was already there rather than spend any time reconciling children. Otherwise, we need to call the other lifecycle methods as appropriate. Note: I’m using the “classic” lifecycle methods here, some of which are soon to be phased out (including my dear old friend, &lt;code&gt;componentWillReceiveProps&lt;/code&gt; who I probably abused like everybody else leading to React getting rid of it - this is why we can’t have nice things). I hope to upgrade to the new &lt;code&gt;getDerivedStateFromProps&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getSnapshotBeforeUpdate&lt;/code&gt; in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the changes are queued up, its just a matter of making the right changes to the DOM during the final commit phase. Once we’ve processed the whole queue, we set a &lt;code&gt;pendingCommit&lt;/code&gt; variable to the root node. Throughout the whole process phase, we have collected all the changes that need to happen for a node and its children and passed them up to the parent, meaning that by now the root should have an array of all the changes that need to take place this re-render. Each change is a POJO with reference to the nodes in question and their parent, so this is not too hard: append the new element to the parent if its a placement, update its properties if its an update to an existing node, and remove from the DOM if its going away or being replaced. If the node is an instance of a class, I call &lt;code&gt;componentWillUnmount&lt;/code&gt; before the actual deletion — at least for now, since its also being deprecated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding a functional component was fairly easy after figuring out how the class lifecycle worked. We needed a way to distinguish functions that were just pure functional components and functions that were constructors for a class component — I eventually settled for checking to see if the function in question had lifecycle methods defined on their &lt;code&gt;prototype&lt;/code&gt; since all classes that extend &lt;code&gt;Weact.Component&lt;/code&gt; will inherit them. This approach works but doesn’t necessarily seem like the most elegant solution. I’d like to revisit with a better approach. But for now, if we have determined we are working with a pure function, we just find out the new state of the DOM for that node by running it and passing in the new props.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of tiny implementation details I’m skipping over, of course. You can check out &lt;a href=&quot;www.github.com/matthaws/weact&quot;&gt;my github repo&lt;/a&gt; to see the code itself and my working demo of Weact in action. Overall, though, it was an incredibly educational and rewarding project and not just in the incremental rendering part. Writing &lt;code&gt;Weact.createElement&lt;/code&gt; and teaching Babel to use it to process JSX was really rewarding, and really helped me peer beneath the super useful “magic” that JSX really is for working React. Overall, I was left deeply awed by the clever team that works on React and by just how much really was happening when I make my React apps that I never have to even think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend recreating this project or a similar one for tech that you use frequently. Nothing helps you understand a tool better than taking it apart and putting it back together, and nothing is quite so satisfying either. Give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Problem of Altered Carbon]]></title><description><![CDATA[I love sci-fi and I love noir -- so why do I feel so guilty about liking Netflix's 'Altered Carbon'?]]></description><link>https://matthaws.github.io/the-blog/posts/altered-carbon/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://matthaws.github.io/the-blog/posts/altered-carbon/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Mar 2018 22:40:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science fiction is, at its core, a thought experiment. Take an idea about what human civilization might eventually be (no matter how probable or improbable) and carry it to its natural conclusion — and then see what is revealed about us in the process. Science fiction often features spaceships, virtual worlds, lasers, and monsters, but its not &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; those things. It’s about us, a look at humans through the lens of the what-if premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noir is a totally different take on humanity, showing off the nitty gritty of our dark underside. It’s a bleak modern version of the timeless hero’s journey, with the detective starting out to unravel “the mystery” — only to find in time that the mystery, the &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt;, was not the one they thought it was. And, most importantly, that they themselves have been changed in the process of unraveling the truth. Revealing the secrets of the case unearths secrets about society, and most importantly secrets about the detective themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both genres entertain with evocative settings and larger-than-life characters, and both offer a certain appeal of escapism from the mundane aspects of day-to-day life, but they also contain hidden depths of a more philosophical bent. Perhaps this is why I like these genres so much. I particularly like the resulting combo when you blend the two together, as in such notable films as &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; and its imitators. I myself once wrote a noir-esque novella about a murder taking place in a colony where all the inhabitants are clones of the same man, and of the clone who is tasked to find the killer. Clearly, the sci-fi noir blend brings out the nerdy fanboy in me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can imagine my excitement when I heard about &lt;em&gt;Altered Carbon&lt;/em&gt;, the new sci-fi noir epic on Netflix. I don’t tend to binge watch TV, even shows I like, preferring instead to digest each episode with a little space in between, but I made my way through &lt;em&gt;Altered Carbon&lt;/em&gt; within a little more than a week. Despite my enthusiasm, I tried to go into the series with lowered expectations. And yet, to my pleasant surprise, I liked so much about it and even (and this is so rare these days) felt fairly satisfied by the way it ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I feel guilty for liking it. And a bit afraid to tell people that I enjoyed it. There’s a lot going here, I need to unpack this a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of the show, future humanity has developed technology that allows their consciousness to be saved onto a cartridge or “stack” that sits at the base of the neck. As long as the cartridge is kept intact, the consciousness of that person never truly dies, no matter what happens to their body. And in fact, the stack can be moved from body to body — the disconnect of mind and body, so pronounced in modern western cultures, is taken to an extreme limit. Now, a “person” &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the cartridge, and the body they inhabit is merely a temporary vehicle, a “sleeve” for their consciousness. The premise of the show could have been gimmicky except that, like in the best examples of sci-fi, the “what-if” thought experiment of the show is used to further both the plot and a deeper inquiry into human society and the human soul. Its a little ham-handed at times, but the pulply noir tone of the show makes usually makes it somehow work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic plot is that protagonist Takeshi Kovacs is brought back into the world (his long-unused stack inserted into a new body) by the request of an extremely wealthy aristocrat, Laurens Bancroft, in order to solve his murder. Bancroft was killed days earlier, shot through the stack. This would be the end of most people, but being so immensely wealthy Bancroft is able to back up his consciousness to the cloud every 48 hours and thus able to be revived inside one of his many clones. Kovacs is tasked by Bancroft to find his murderer and figure out what happened, since Bancroft himself has no memory of anything that happened after his most recent back-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the noir archetypes are present: Kovacs himself is the jaded, cynical detective with a spotted past. Whereas many of the classic noir stories had the detective as a war veteran or some other shadowed backstory, Kovacs is a former member of a legendary revolutionary movement whose operatives were renowed for their skill and ruthless efficiency. When he’s awakened at the start of the story, his revolution has been dead for over two hundred years and his association with it is seen as a quaint, interesting relic from the past, leaving him literally a man-out-of-time. Bancroft’s wife is the classic femme-fatale, a woman with a motive and a capacity for brutality who uses her sexuality to try to distract and control the investigation. And there’s even the hardened but still idealistic cop (in the form of Lieutenant Kristin Ortega) trying to fight the injustices of society despite the cynical nihilism of her superiors. These noir tropes are enmeshed in sci-fi/cyberpunk ones: virtual reality, sentient AIs, advanced psychotropic drugs, cloning, prosthetic limbs, and communication devices embedded into eye-balls all make an appearance in the plot. It all somehow works together, mostly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the over-arching thought experiment — what if humans found the key to immortality, what if humans were no longer bound to one body — keeps popping up in new and interesting ways. Lieutenant Ortega “spins up” the stack of her grandmother in order to bring her to her family’s Dia de los Muertos celebration, as is apparently tradition. She does so using whatever sleeve she has at hand in the police station, the body of a bearded, burly, tattooed gang member. One of the antagonists, the criminal renegade named Dimitri, has made an illegal copy of his stack that he refers to as his brother, and is renowned for jumping from sleeve to sleeve as part of his nefarious activities — meaning that at least 3 actors that I can remember play Dimitri at some point during the show. Some devout faithful (the neo-Catholics specifically, we are told) believe that while stacks preserve the mind, the soul dies with the body, and thus refuse to be spun back up after their sleeve dies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this, together with engaging but not too rushed pacing, makes the show very watchable. And the overall arc of the character and the revelations of the plot are, while a bit convenient at times, satisfying and interesting. So why do I feel &lt;em&gt;guilty&lt;/em&gt; for liking this? If its not exactly highbrow, if its a bit pulpy and silly, well that’s never stopped me from unapologetically loving something before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the show is problematic — but not just that its problematic, which I would know how to deal with, but &lt;em&gt;problematically&lt;/em&gt; problematic. What am I supposed to do with that?&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious elephant-in-the-room is that Takeshi Kovacs, a half-European, half-Japanese man, is played throughout the series by a white actor. There’s an in universe, perfectly valid explanation for this in that Bancroft had Kovacs spun up specifically in the sleeve of (minor spoiler) policeman and Ortega’s lover Riker, a white man, to make use of Riker’s strength and military reflexes but also as a big middle finger to Ortega herself. People mistake Kovacs for Riker, and he generally has to deal with being in a body that is not his own. He’s no stranger to this, however, having jumped from sleeve to sleeve a lot during his time as a revolutionary and beforehand when he was in the military. And the original Takeshi Kovacs is played in extensive flashbacks as both a child and a revolutionary by actors of Asian descent. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; this is exactly what happens in the book and they are being true to the source material. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; the actor (Joel Kinnaman) is actually pretty great in the part, considering he’s a brooding hard-boiled detective who shows little emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite all that, and despite the show wrestling with what things like racial and gender identity even &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; when your body no longer defines who you are, there’s no escaping that this is a story about a half-Asian man and the lead actor is white. There’s been a lot of attention on this kind of whitewashing in casting lately, and for good reason, and even though I think this is less egregious than other examples, in the context of that on-going conversation it seems like an awkward choice on the part of the producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to brush aside this kind of critique given that the show does such an excellent job at explaining and wrestling with the disparity between Kovac’s identity and the body he is (temporarily) inhabiting, a major theme of the show across all the characters. But again and again, I thought of other recent examples of whitewashing of Asian roles by white actors — examples such as Scarlett Johanssen in &lt;em&gt;Ghost in the Shell&lt;/em&gt;, a film which similarly tried to explain away the casting in-world by depicting a character whose entire identity, including her race, had been stolen from her when she had been inserted into a robotic body. Like &lt;em&gt;Altered Carbon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ghost&lt;/em&gt; tried to make the casting okay by wrestling with the difficult implications of it, certainly a step forward (maybe a tiny step) from previous whitewashed casting where its not discussed or addressed at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in both cases, we cannot dismiss that reality that ultimately the decision of which actor to cast was made in the real world and for real world reasons. White actors were placed in those roles because of the belief that people would be less likely to watch a show or movie with a non-white lead. It would be naive to think that this entrenched Hollywood opinion (which blockbusters like &lt;em&gt;Black Panter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Get Out&lt;/em&gt; are hopefully disproving, he said idealistically) had nothing to do with the casting no matter how fully addressed it is in world. And that’s messed up.&lt;/p&gt;

        alt=&quot;The Bancrofts&quot;
        title=&quot;&quot;

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there is the show’s treatment of women. Like many noir stories, women are frequently victims and the show ultimately ends up revolving around a prostitution service for the rich where they are allowed to torture and kill (like, &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; kill, destroy their stacks) girls in addition to having sex with them. The idea is that the basically immortal rich have grown so numb and desensitized that only these kinds of extremes can get them off anymore. But, similar to the whitewashed casting, the relentless depiction of violence towards and objectification of women makes it hard to feel totally at ease with the show. And there’s Mrs. Bancroft, of course, a prowling she-wolf sexual predator who is basically a pure villain all but twirling an invisible moustache as she tries to seduce Kovacs, even offering him a life of luxury on an island full of her clones, his own personal harem, in exchange for him to give up the investigation. Bancroft is flawed and ultimately a bad guy, but he’s interesting, complicated, and fully fleshed out as a character. His wife on the other hand is reduced to a femme fatale archetype cliche for the majority of the show. And there’s another female character, deeply traumatized after being attacked by a group of men, whose redemption arc is simply that she is trained to defend herself and become an instrument of violent vengeance rampaging through groups of men kicking some serious butt. And while it was fun to watch her dispensing a kind of haggard justice, it felt a bit wrong to suggest that learning to kick and punch is all it takes to recover from that kind of deep trauma, not to mention that her “beat up the dudes” moments still somehow managed to sexualize her in costume and choreography for the male gaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet! Ortega is a badass Latina police officer, interesting, flawed, very likeable, though a bit obsessed with Kovacs and its a few episodes before we understand why. But I loved her! Her heritage and her family are a big part of her identity and the plot of the show without feeling like a gimmick. Kovacs recruits other helpers in his investigation, including a bi-racial couple and their daughter and, it occurred to me while watching with a little guilty surprise, black/white couples are still rarely seen on TV. For some of the show, the wife of the couple has been put into a man’s body against her will, and it is touching to see how easily her husband accepts that this man is his wife after only a little initial awkwardness — the lack of gay panic from the male character in the situation was refreshing — and how immediately her daughter is able to recognize without any prompting that &lt;em&gt;that’s her mom&lt;/em&gt;, like some kind of instinct, no matter what the body looks like. I teared up a bit in that scene…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legendary leader of the revolution and Kovac’s hero and inspiration (and, in many hazy dreams and waking visions, the manifestation of his subconscious) is a black woman who is a heroic warrior, an intelligent and passionate scientist, and a wise mentor and teacher. But… of course we have some problematic aspects to her character once she falls for Kovacs during the backstory flashbacks and only appears in the main thrust of the story as a kind of disembodied vision thay only Kocacs can see. The love story is handled well and stays true to her character, but I couldn’t help but feel cheated that this character ended up being motivated by love for a man, given that she had previously been about so much more than that, and that as a ghost she existed more as a support and cheerleader. It really works with the story, but as a broad concept its the same kind of stuff we’ve seen over and over for female and minority roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, while the Bancrofts are as white as Wonder bread, the rest of the cast of the show is as diverse as any show made in 2017 should be.  But this only makes the decision to cast a tall blonde white actor, a very conventional leading man, as Kovacs the more out of place. And yet (again)! If the story is about him being spun up in a body that is not his own, would it have worked in telling that story if the new body was &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; Asian or half-Asian? If he had been played by a non-Asian actor from some other racial background, would that have been much less problematic? What about when Ortega’s grandmother is brought back (memorably and rather adorably) in the body of the bearded, burly white gangster, only for Dimitri to possess that same body later in the show (yes, one actor played 3 roles). Was that problematic, or is this kind of racial and gender bending the &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt; of the show and its thought experiment? It’s impossible for me to discuss the reality of the casting and the dynamics of gender separate from the meanings and themes of the show and the character, and it all turns into a jumbled mess of conclusions. I have no clear or easy way to categorize this casting, to either excuse it or to condemn it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we humans are not great at dealing with things we can’t fully categorize. I ultimately was able to categorically condemn the casting of Scar Jo in &lt;em&gt;Ghost in the Shell&lt;/em&gt;, even though she gave a decent performance and the original creator of the anime on which it was based was supposedly in favor of her taking the part. All things said and done, none of that justified the decision for me. And it didn’t hurt that at the end of the day the movie wasn’t very good anyway, definitely making it an easier decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while I know some of my friends have found it equally as easy to denounce, I find &lt;em&gt;Altered Carbon&lt;/em&gt; much harder to parse. The issues feel more complicated and, mucking up my judgment, I rather liked it. Some episodes had me on the edge of my seat. Like all good sci-fi, it asks hard questions along the way towards telling a silly fun story, and I’m left pondering a lot of things about human consciousness, identity, mortality, and relationships. But I can’t fully be at ease with it all either. I can forgive some of the chunky dialogue, as it suits the genre. I can forgive the rather wrapped-up-too-neatly ending, as it fits the genre as well. But I’m left troubled by casting complications and the depiction of women without being able to definitively say what should have been different that would have left me less disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first season wrapped up neatly enough that I would be content if Netflix never ordered a second — and its difficult to say how well it went over with audiences anyway, since I’ve yet to meet anybody who liked it nearly as much as I did. But if there should be a second season, and given that there are additional books in the series on which it was based that’s theoretically possible, there’s an opportunity for some changes. At the end of the final episode, Kovacs surrenders Riker’s body so that Riker can be returned to his former life — which means that Kovacs, in his return in a second season, should be played be a completely different actor. This enigmatic protagonist could therefore continue to be played by multiple actors over the life of the show, a kind of Dr. Who situation that would not only further the thought experiment of this strange world but also allow for interesting shades of the character to be brought to light by different actors. Riker could return, theoretically, with that actor now playing him in a supportive role instead of Kovacs. But should a second season come along with Joel Kinnaman as Takeshi Kovacs again, against all reason both in the world of the show and in our world, I will find it quite difficult to excuse and would likely not watch it. I want to believe that Netflix wouldn’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe I’m being overly optimistic?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Building a Eurovision App - Part Two]]></title><description><![CDATA[Work begins on our Eurovision Scoring app]]></description><link>https://matthaws.github.io/the-blog/posts/eurovision-app-part-two</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://matthaws.github.io/the-blog/posts/eurovision-app-part-two</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2018 22:40:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h1&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our plan for the app more or less in place, I got started building both our front and backend pieces from scratch. The first thing I knew I wanted to work out was a login via Facebook. There are a number of libraries designed to help you paper over the OAuth2 protocol that allows to you to authenticate with third-party providers like Facebook, but I wanted to at least try to implement it myself in order to better understand what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I learned a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAuth2 is a fairly straightforward process under normal conditions. After registering my app with Facebook, I just needed to provide FB with a callback URL that it would send a response to once it was done authenticating the user.  However, because we were essentially working with two different apps (a Rails JSON API server and a React app), the normal OAuth flow was trickier than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user is interacting with the React frontend and kicks off the login process from there. Should I send a request to my backend Rails API, which then authenticates with Facebook and returns a response? The chain of asynchronous calls that would involve seemed like a nightmare and after tinkering I decided that wasn’t an ideal solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, if I sent the request to Facebook via the frontend, I would still need to send the response on to Rails in order to create or find the appropriate user in my database. That didn’t seem like a great solution either. Considering that having the frontend and backend seems very commonplace or even ideal in certain situations, I was surprised by the lack of guides or published best practices on how to handle OAuth2 authentication under those circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I decided to go with the second option and have my frontend contact Facebook. The decision ultimately came down to which process would give the best user experience. By integrating my frontend Javascript with Facebook via their SDK, I was able to have a Facebook login window pop up to ask the user to log in and give permission to the app. In the success callback to that async call, I then start a Redux loop that sends the temporary access token that Facebook gave me to my Rails backend. Rails can then use that token to fetch user information including a unique id from Facebook, which I use as my primary means of user lookup in my database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means two requests to Facebook, one from my frontend, one from my backend. I’m not thrilled with that, but it seemed to be the best solution given the tools I had and what I knew how to do in the moment. I’m sure there must be a better way, but I went with this solution for time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to send the user’s temporary access token to my backend in an HTTP request, I learned about HTTP Basic Auth protocol which involves an “Authentication” header and Base64 encoding. Koala, a handy gem for Rails, provided a nice API for using that access token to then fetch user information from FB, including name and profile picture.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;uid&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; uid&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;first_or_initialize&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;tap &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;user&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    user&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;uid &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; uid
    user&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;username &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; username
    user&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;avatar_url &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; photo_url
    user&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;save&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I could get user information and could make or find the user’s entry in my database. But what about persisting the state of being “logged in”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Logged In - What Does That Even Mean?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous web apps, I’d used cookies to maintain the concept of a current user and being logged in. When a user logs in, a session token is generated and saved in a column in that user’s entry in the database and the same token is put in the session cookie for the app. Rails makes working with cookies incredibly simple, so this was a pretty quick and easy way to implement auth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I wasn’t convinced that was the best solution and wanted to try another approach. With a session token, you have to store extra auth-related information in the database. That information needs to be reset on each log out and log in, adding extra work for the server. Furthermore, truly RESTful APIs should technically be stateless. Session tokens were a great way to get started with authentication, but now that I had a solid grasp on that approach I knew I didn’t want to simply use them again for this new project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I researched other alternatives. JSON Web Tokens are an interesting solution for this problem. Instead of using a persistent cookie, we send the client a specially generated token as part of the Rails response when they log in. That token is stored in the browser locally through sessionStorage and then included in the “Authentication” header of all future HTTP requests to my API endpoints that require a logged in user. Now the actual controller actions are actually stateless as a helper method checks the viability of the token in the header before running the action, keeping the API far more RESTful. On a refresh of the app, if there’s a token being stored locally the app knows to go and fetch the current user’s data using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function-variable function&quot;&gt;authHeaders&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;sessionStorage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;token&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      Authorization&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token template-string&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`bearer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;sessionStorage&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;getItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;token&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation-punctuation punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked out nicely and was straightforward to implement. I’ve definitely read about some downsides to JWTs in terms of security and also efficiency when scaling a service. It puts the logic for being logged in or not on the client side, which means giving up some control - I read of one company that needed users to log out in order to have access to a new feature. If they had session tokens, they could just reset them for all users effectively logging everyone out very efficiently and knowing their feature was now accessible by everybody. Without that ability, they were relying on their users logging out in order to clear the JSON Web Token, and had to basically beg them repeatedly through lots of messages to do so, a much lengthier and more annoying process. Plus, JWT  relies on my app’s secret key to generate the tokens, and if that single key were to be compromised it could mean all the tokens are vulnerable. But for the scope of our little app I felt these issues would not be relevant and the ease of implementation, the benefit of learning a new kind of authentication protocol, and JWTs other pluses as outlined above made it worth it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Building a Eurovision App - Part One]]></title><description><![CDATA[The story of conceiving, planning, and beginning to build a social Eurovision scoring web application.]]></description><link>https://matthaws.github.io/the-blog/posts/eurovision-app-part-one</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://matthaws.github.io/the-blog/posts/eurovision-app-part-one</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 22:40:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h1&gt;The Idea&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could write an entire blog post on why I love the Eurovision Song Contest so much — and maybe eventually I will. But for the sake of brevity &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest&quot;&gt;here’s a link to the Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; about it and an image that sums it all up:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was first introduced to the glory that is Eurovision in 2004 when I was in London for a semester abroad and happened to catch it on TV. It’s a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; event in Europe, and while as many Europeans hate is as love it, it’s as impossible to avoid as the Super Bowl or the Olympics, which makes it particularly interesting that so few Americans have heard of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was re-introduced to Eurovision some years later by my friend Brendan, a die-hard fan with an encyclopedic knowledge of past contests and winners. For years, it had been his tradition to hold annual Eurovision parties with friends to watch and score the entries not according to the official system of the contest but based on his own custom criteria on hand-made scoresheets: up to 12 points each in the categories of song, dance, costume, and “eurocheese”, with an optional field for arbitrary bonus points. Everybody rates each entry and then argues with each other about their ratings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was fun. A lot of fun. We do it every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, naturally, when Brendan and I both made career transitions into web development we knew we wanted to turn his annual scoring game into a social web app that we, our friends, and any Eurovision lover with a healthy sense of humor could use. And thus, &lt;em&gt;Douze Points&lt;/em&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Designing the App&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew we wanted this application to be a platform and demo for the web development skills we’ve learned but also to push and challenge us to go further. Using that criteria, the high-level shape of the app started to come together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core MVP features to be implemented in the first iteration of the app were soon fleshed out. When finished, users would be able to:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;log in with their Facebook account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;view past contests and entries (with embedded Youtube links)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make “scoresheets”, each associated with a given year’s contests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give each entry on a scoresheet a scoring, with up to 12 points assigned in each category just like in Brendan’s home-made sheets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;view each other’s scoresheets and profiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leave comments on entries, scoresheets, and profiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;follow other users to see recent activity on the home page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building off the tech stack we already knew, we started to visualize the completed app in the following parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Backend API&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up was a JSON API that would be implemented using Rails 5 in API-only mode and a PostgreSQL database. Designing the database schema proved interesting given the requirements of the MVPs and the interconnectedness of the proposed tables. We settled on this configuration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Countries would have a name and a url for their flag image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contests would have a year and have a foreign key pointing to their host country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entries would belong to a country and a contest, and have columns containing the url of an associated video, title of song, name of artist, and their final ranking and score in the official contest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users would have many scoresheets. Scoresheets would also need to belong to the contest they were scoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scoresheets would have many scorings. Scorings would represent the set of scores a user gave to one individual entry, so it would serve a join table between scoresheets and entries and would contain the user’s scores for the four categories and the bonus field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, comments would be allowed to be associated with many of the other tables via Rails’ polymorphic associations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a model of our proposed database:  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backend routes and controllers were designed according to RESTful conventions and we would use jbuilder to shape our JSON responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Frontend&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the app itself, we decided to go with React/Redux, with which we were already very familiar. We also decided to use create-react-app to quickly get started with developing. I’ve been in love with create-react-app for a while now and was itching to use it in a full-fledged project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key to group collaboration was to decide on stylistic conventions and a normalized state shape for our Redux store. We decided we would use prettier to help us keep to a consistent style (I’m a big fan of it as well!). Our driving guideline for state shape was to consistently store all resources in their slice of state under keys of their ids. Resources that referenced others (such as a scoresheet that had many scorings) would hold an array of the ids of the resources that they need (easily produced on the backend with ActiveRecord’s #pluck method and our jbuilder views). With an array of scoring ids, for example, we could easily grab all the scorings that a scoresheet needed out of their slice of state without the need to iterate through all of the scorings stored there. Keeping the Redux store consistent and easy to use would save us a lot of pain down the road — pain that we had both learned about the hard way on other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to the styling and UI, Brendan and I bounced around and also looped in my partner, Ian, who has a design background and who had expressed interest in helping us design and implement the project, particularly the frontend styling and React components. I’m a big fan of teamwork and collaboration, so I was excited to get another person’s perspective on the project. After hearing what we wanted from the app, he went and made some very basic wireframes for us to start to get an idea of what it might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I wrote my long-winded, unnecessarily detailed, and generally scathing critique of “Rogue One” as a way of processing both why such a silly action movie offended me so deeply and also why this space opera saga meant so much to me in the first place. The essay grew out of frustrating conversations with deeply loved friends and fellow-fans who disagreed with me on what makes the Star Wars universe so satisfying and compelling, and allowed me to put into words more carefully all the reasons why Rogue One let me down. In the interest of intellectual integrity and consistency, I felt it worthwhile to hold up the newest film to the same scrutiny and see how “The Last Jedi” measures up to my highly scientific (lol) standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My previous post lays out four core elements that to me define the essence of the Star Wars films that launched the franchise: 1) heroic, likable, relatable characters, 2) allegorical plot, 3) unique genre/tone, and 4) use of the symbolism and myth. It is these qualities, and not surface details like lightsabers, X-wings, or Darth Vader choking people, that actually makes something Star Wars. It’s perfectly easy to make a movie that uses all the surface details, that makes an intense amount of surface references to the other films, but in its heart has nothing in common thematically or spiritually with the franchise — in other words, Rogue One. Without making use of any of these four core elements, the film is a soul-less imitation of something it clearly does not really understand. It’s like if I got on a stage and performed a scene from “Twilight” but tried to convince you it was actually Shakespeare because I happened to be wearing an Elizabethan outfit complete with ruff and an elegant codpiece. Of course it’s Shakespeare! THERE’S A COD PIECE IN IT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how Rogue One fans come across to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we aren’t here to talk about Rogue One. How does The Last Jedi hold up? It is, after all, it’s own animal, wildly different in tone and direction than both “Rogue One” and in many respects its predecessor, “The Force Awakens.” Rian Johnson was only too happy to take what JJ Abrams handed him and toss it over his shoulder — quite literally.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the first core element: heroic characters. Star Wars characters stick with us because they are relatable and flawed, even occasionally ridiculous and silly, but ultimately rise to their occasion and fulfill heroic arcs. This is one category where JJ Abrams did a fairly decent job in “The Force Awakens.” He had the big task of introducing us to an entirely new set of Star Wars protagonists and trying to make room in our hearts for them alongside our old favorites, and ultimately I found Rey, Finn, and Poe pretty lovable. They were characters with a sense of humor who didn’t take themselves too seriously, but who could have serious moments where they faced serious choices. They were rough sketches of characters, much as Luke, Han, and Leia were still rough sketches by the end of A New Hope, but they were a solid start. A compelling villain is also a key character in this kind of story, and Episode VII delivered spectacularly with the angsty Kylo Ren, the perfect inversion of Luke Skywalker who lived in the shadow of Darth Vader in much the same way as the entire film had to live in the shadow of the original trilogy. He was interesting. He was familiar but different. And he resonated with deep symbolic significance for our time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Last Jedi’s job was to further develop these characters and their arcs. In some cases, it did only a mediocre job with this. I don’t think Johnson was sure what he wanted to do with Finn and Poe, they felt extraneous to the story he was really interested in. Finn goes from wanting to run away to being a full-fledged participant in the Resistance, and Poe learns that true leadership requires restraint and looking at the big picture. Ok, fine, I guess. These are mini-arcs for characters who feel less important to the story than they did in the last film. Finn and Poe’s relationship with each other (or with Rey) is not developed in any way which is truly a shame, as we would hope that going into the third act our main three players would have developed more nuanced, complicated views of each other. We get a new character, Rose, who was also likable in her way and who seems to be suddenly crushing on Finn by the end of the movie, but even those two don’t seem to have gotten close in any kind of nuanced way through their experience. There’s a reason these characters and relationships don’t really go anywhere in this film — the film isn’t interested in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with so many things in The Last Jedi, where the film (i.e., Rian Johnson) isn’t interested, the movie falls flat. But where he is interested, it soars and sings. In this case, the key development is in the characters of Rey, Ben, and Luke. The almost arbitrary encounters between Rey and her nemesis Kylo could have been forced and lifeless — they were not. Through this link we see the two of them go from confrontational to almost resigned to the other’s presence to finally forming a kind of deep connection that neither has ever really had and both have longed for — and it happens with the last person in the galaxy they expected. The complication of a relationship that had previously been purely antagonistic is both interesting and incredibly Star Wars. As Rey grows disillusioned with her hero of legend Luke Skywalker, she simultaneously comes to see signs of Ben Solo inside of Kylo Ren, and not only that begins to understand and relate to him — and in this parallels Luke’s relationship to Vader in a new and interesting way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of this interesting connection is what Ben sees in Rey. Ben Solo’s darkness is everything that Anakin Skywalker’s should have been, had the prequels been competently written and directed. His pain and motivation are believable. His anger is frighteningly honest. We know Kylo Ren. He’s the teenage boy driven to unspeakable acts by loneliness, fear, trauma, and an inability to deal with or express emotion. Kylo Ren is any of the young men who have recently taken a gun and opened fired on a crowd — the fiction presents us with an interpretation of a sincere fear that plagues us in our society. He stands vividly in the mythology of Star Wars because we know the kind of monster he is, and we can painfully sympathize with him even while being horrified at his acts of violence. Ben’s haughty dismissal of Rey in “The Force Awakens” has been complicated by the beginning of this film. She beat him, first of all, quite the humbling experience for a man who hides his insecurity with shows of pride and power. Fans who complain that there’s no way Rey, who had never picked up a lightsaber before, could defeat a young man who had been training for years, miss the point. They have been clouded by the realism of the prequels, which tried to explain everything logically as though this was a real story about real people in a real world. This is a fairy tale — the winner of a lightsaber duel is NOT the one who has trained the most. The winner of the lightsaber duel is the one whose will is stronger, the one who is most in tune with their place in the universe (with the Force). Kylo’s will was torn to pieces by his murder of his father and he was unable to muster the focus and resolve to match Rey’s, whose desperation honed her will to a sharp point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humbled by his defeat, when Ben Solo sees Rey through their connected moments, he forms a vulnerable connection to another human being for the first time in years. Rey sees through to the core of him, as nothing can be hidden from the Force. She sees him naked as much symbolically as literally. There’s a part of him that needs and cherishes this connection, so much so that he’s unable to allow his master to kill her. But the twist is that, unlike Anakin, this newfound connection to another does not save him from the darkness — it only drives him further into it. He needs her. I am incredibly grateful that this connection and need is never characterized as romantic or sexual just because they happen to be oppositely gendered characters, a choice that speaks volumes as to the originality of Rian Johnson’s vision. The connection is strong and Ben genuinely wants Rey to rule the galaxy as his equal partner and gender is irrelevant here. Two souls have brushed up against each other. Twisted by his pain and need, he’s even willing to emotionally brutalize and cripple her to control her — and anybody who has seen an unhealthy relationship between two friends or partners can attest to the stark reality this embodies. “You’re nothing,” he tells her, “Nobody cares about you, only me. I’m the only friend you have.” This desire to control and manipulate and own in order not to be left alone is the Dark Side in its rawest form, far scarier and more real to us than Snoke’s fancy displays of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reveal of the non-importance of Rey’s parentage was exactly the right creative decision and one of the highlights of the film. That moment will forever live in epic Star Wars history every bit as shocking and thrilling and so damn right as “I am your father.” When Vader reveals Luke is his son, we are horrified even as, like Luke, we know in our hearts that it is true. So too with Rey — all the months of speculating who she could be, how she fit into this family saga, theories ranging from the the bizarre (she’s a Kenobi! She’s Emperor Palpatine! She’s Anakin reborn!) to the likely (I was pretty sure they were just gonna make her Ben’s sister) but none of these alternatives satisfies quite so much nor fit Rey’s character arc more perfectly than to discover that her driving motivation — her absolute conviction that she has a family somewhere that cares about her and whose identity will reveal her own — was based entirely on delusion created by a traumatized, abandoned child. The reveal lands solidly, though its slightly watered down by the fact that, unlike Luke’s shocking discovery in Episode V, there’s like an hour of movie after it. But that’s another issue. That moment in its isolation is perfectly delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other character arc Rian Johnson is interested in, and rightfully so, is that of our erstwhile protagonist Luke Skywalker. After decades of waiting to see him on screen again and especially after the bold tease of “The Force Awakens”, we finally got to reunite with our hero of childhood. After all those years, the hype was insane. How could anything Luke do in this movie live up to that much expectation? The answer is, of course, that it can’t — which is why you don’t even try, which is why you show that Luke suffers under the weight of his own legend and celebrity as the movie itself does with the hype of its predecessors. I am surprised, a bit, to hear some fanboys complain about Luke as the moody, jaded, failed teacher. I thought these fans liked their precious Extended Universe! The theme of Luke struggling to be a good teacher and often failing has been explored in several EU novels, and it makes sense. Being a good teacher is difficult,  the responsibility of guiding someone through adolescence and into maturity and adulthood is a fragile and heavy burden. Star Wars has always been interested in the relationship between teachers and students, and the idea of the master who failed to pass on his wisdom to a pupil is baked right into the core concept of the very first film. It makes even more sense for Luke, who was barely ever even trained himself. Somehow he was supposed to become a wise teacher and master and he just had to figure out how to do that with very little guidance. Watching Ben Solo drift away from him meant Luke had to come face to face with his own shortcomings in a whole new way. Defeating the Empire is one thing, getting through to a troubled teen is a problem of a whole other kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is parallelism done right. JJ’s attempts at parallelism in “The Force Awakens” come off more like simple paint-by-numbers copying, but here our familiarity with Luke’s backstory and the previous films enhances our understanding of his arc. Luke is fully aware of the irony that he has basically turned into Obi-Wan, in exile after failing as a teacher and knowing his former student has gone on to wreak chaos and destruction in the galaxy. When Artoo plays the legendary message from Leia begging help from General Kenobi, he can’t help but realize what he’s become. His confession about the night he was tempted to strike down Ben before he could turn to evil was supremely human and actually fits Luke’s character perfectly. When faced with a vision of evil in the cave on Dagobah, he lashed out and tried to destroy it — a reaction that Yoda referred to later as “his failure.” It’s ever been Luke’s weakness to brashly want to lash out and squash the darkness as though it were some kind of evil Other outside of himself, forgetting for a moment that the lashing out itself IS the evil. The revelation of the cave on Dagobah, that the evil he wanted to destroy was a part of himself, was inside himself, is mirrored by the outcome of that night at Ben Solo’s bedside. His fear that Ben would go to the Dark Side was itself a temptation of the Dark Side, a temptation inside everybody including Jedi Masters who have faced it again and again. Its his brush with that temptation that becomes the trigger that sets Ben off down the very path Luke had feared he would go. Rey takes him to task for this failure with all the indignation of youth, and Luke says nothing in his defense. He knows she’s right, and despite all his years and experience our Master Skywalker is still unable to deal with this failure and guilt. Knowing that he helped create a monster like Vader must have felt like all his previous battles were for nothing. How many parents swear they will raise their children better than their parents raised them, only to make so many of the same mistakes and pass down the family traumas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is heavy stuff. But it suits the characters and the themes of the saga absolutely perfectly. Luke is still somehow Luke under that gruff exterior, displays a grumpy humor that hints at his former self, and when he smiles at Artoo and calls the droid by name it felt like being reunited with an old friend. Sure, they’ve changed. They aren’t how you remember. Time has not been kind to them. But that’s the friend you grew up with at the core, straight out of your memories, bursting through all the nostalgia and fully realized again. I’ll admit that I wept. I knew Mark Hamill was in this movie, of course, but I never dared hope that I’d actually get Luke, my Luke, back. So whatever other flaws the movie has I have to give Johnson credit for those wonderful moments where he managed to do the impossible. Credit also goes to Hamill himself, of course, whose performance in the whole film is true gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ending Johnson gave to the character of Luke Skywalker was beautifully filmed and had a nice symmetry — but felt like wrong ending to the arc of the character as sketched out in the movie up until that point. I’m convinced that in an original draft of the script Luke actually survived, as his sudden union with the Force / death seemed like a hard turn from where the character was progressing. Why have a reveal that Luke wasn’t even there the whole time during the fight with Kylo if, well, actually he’s just gonna die anyway? Having Luke sacrifice himself to buy the Resistance time makes sense, I suppose, but not filming it in such a way where you first feel nervous that Luke is in danger and might die, then experience the relief and pleasure of finding out he never was in danger at all and the whole thing was an elaborate feint, then experience a kind of “oh, well why did any of that matter then” disappointment when he dies anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why did he die? From the exertion of astral projecting through the Force, I guess? To quote Han, “THAT’S NOT HOW THE FORCE WORKS.” This movie itself in previous scenes lays out a view of the Force that disagrees with the very premise that “over-using” the Force would somehow kill you. Unless it wasn’t that effort and, as some of my friends have suggested, it was Luke willingly letting himself become one with the Force because he was finally at peace? I don’t buy it. The whole progression of Luke’s character arc up until the final moment when he disappeared had been one of “your story isn’t over,” and “you still have things to learn,” “learn from your mistakes,” and “there’s still work to do.” I’ll discuss this more when I get to the symbolism and myth of the film, but I can’t stand it when a movie kills off a character just for dramatic payoff when there’s no logical reason that person needed to die, and I’m a bit tired of movies showcasing older characters whose only real purpose is to die off because only the young characters actually matter. Han’s death didn’t feel cheap. It was tragic. It fit the themes of the saga. It was a result of the decision he made to face his son, a decision he knew was risky, and the decision Ben made to try to “kill the past” and the light still flickering inside his soul. The son facing the father is a core element of Star Wars. Luke’s felt… extraneous, however beautifully filmed. In it’s way, it attempts to be a bit like Obi-Wan’s sacrifice, but it was not set up in the same way. It’s possible, of course, that he’ll still be in Episode IX and that we’ll get a little more completion to his arc. But up until the moment Luke faded away I was 100% perfectly happy with how the film had treated his character and then suddenly I felt cheated. It felt like it was an arbitrary decision in an arc that had been very carefully constructed up until that point.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on to the second element of Star Wars films: allegorical plot. Each movie in this franchise is full of action adventure. We got to get the thing to stop the thing to save the galaxy. Nothing revolutionary in that, most action films follow a similar structure. What made the original trilogy stand our and last in our memory is the unique way in which it is able to get us to be absolutely invested in the outcome even though this is an entirely fictional galaxy full of entirely fictional people. It does this through its layering of both the personal drama (Luke vs Vader) together with the epic (the Rebellion vs the Empire). Each conflict reinforces, enhances, and serves as a symbol for the other. Here the Last Jedi does a fairly admirable job (with some caveats). The story of this film is the story of darkness and despair slowly but surely grinding down hope. As Ben Solo seeks out every last spot of weakness in his soul and any last vestige of the boy he once was in order to obliterate it, so too does the First Order relentlessly chase down the Resistance and slowly whittle it down until, by the end of the film, it consists solely of a small group of people who fit comfortably inside the Millenium Falcon. Though beaten and weakened and slowly drained of energy and resources, the hope the Resistance represents can’t quite be snuffed out, and Leia in all her wisdom is certain its still enough to burn away the First Order’s oppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symbolic nature of this chase and attrition is just interesting enough for me to overlook silly plot details like the Resistance ships being able to stay “just out of laser range” for hours and hours and the sudden concern about fuel usage in a franchise where this has not ever really been an issue before. Not to mention how communication while in hyperspace works or, for that matter, how you track ships through hyperspace (the details of the “thing” the First Order was using to do that seemed very vague), or why a base with no escape route seemed like a good idea to make. Plot hand-waves like this are fun to joke about (and I’ll be the first to make the jokes) but they are very much not the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve come to the conclusion that there are two kinds of people: people who watch the Death Star trench run in Episode IV and see a thrilling allegory where Luke learns to trust his instincts and surrender in order to succeed, and people who watch it and wonder why such a huge battle station would have such a obvious flaw like a small thermal exhaust port (only two meters wide, mind you) that could allow the entire thing to be blown up. I will never understand why people in the second category became Star Wars fans, but they did, and then somebody made a movie called Rogue One in order to make those people happy and the rest of us miserable. Most of us recognize that the logic of the thermal exhaust port is very much not the point, any more than the logic of Achilles’ vulnerable heel or the Wicked Witch of the West’s severe allergy to water is the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening gambit of taking on the dreadnought was one the first action sequences in ages that actually had me on the edge of my seat, and I felt the raw desperation of the Resistance in the face of overwhelming odds. The movie was really good at evoking that feeling — unfortunately, it over-uses it. We have just one too many “heroes last stand” moments and by the end I was feeling like “ok here we go again” when the Resistance squares off against yet another overwhelming force. I get that in some respects this was intentional — the grueling, exhausting battle for survival in which every step forward is fought for fiercely and paid for in sacrifice. But I can’t help but think that if the movie had been just one epic sequence shorter and left me wanting more I would have stayed engaged more deeply in the world of the film. In general, the movie was just a bit too long because sections of it felt unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About that. So the Canto Bight subplot has received a lot of flak, and I can understand why. It felt like it was taking place in an entirely separate movie, both visually and plot-wise, and struggled to justify its existence in the film. On the surface, I can appreciate what it’s trying to do. When Rose said it was filled with the most terrible people in the galaxy, I was fooled along with a lot of people into expecting some kind of wretched hive of scum and villainy like we’ve seen so many times in Star Wars before — the reveal that this was a fancy place full of rich people was fairly delightful. Unfortunately the plot goes downhill from there. There are lots of antics in the casino, they never make contact with their master codebreaker they were there to find in the first place, and then Benicio del Toro shows up and its sort of like ok what are we doing here, Rian Johnson? Where are you going with this? The idea — that we are going to show that there are forces in the galaxy that profit from the constant fighting, and that Rose and Finn’s heroics inspire a new generation of future freedom fighters — is not exactly terrible, its just a bit awkwardly executed. Not to mention that the sudden political complexity of war profiteers, while making a point that I agree with whole-heartedly on a political level, feels weirdly realistic in a movie that in every other plot line is fantastical. Fantasy represents real-world problems allegorically, but straight up war profiteers wearing top hats and playing in casinos stops being an allegory. It’s the same kind of too-on-the-nose adaptation of real-world concepts that gave us Dexter Jettster and his 50’s style diner on Coruscant in Attack of the Clones (ugh).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s the point — Star Wars works best when it stays in the world of the fable that it is. Whenever it has tried to transgress genre and style, it falls flat. Canto Bight stepped out of fantasy and into… I don’t know. It wasn’t sure what it wanted to be. I can appreciate the goal but not the execution. It really just doesn’t seem like Johnson had any idea what to do with Finn during this movie. As I said before, this is really the biggest disappointment for me in the entire film, as I was looking forward to a more interesting development for his character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other new favorite character, Poe, also had a plot line that struggled a bit though not nearly to the same extent as Finn’s.  (WHY WOULD YOU SEPARATE THESE TWO CHARACTERS FOR ANOTHER FILM, WHAT KIND OF MONSTER DOESN’T WANT TO SEE MORE FINN/POE?) I’m a fan of the wise-cracking hot shot archetype, and I think Poe does a great job embodying that kind of character. It totally makes sense that his arc would include having to adjust from being a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants fighter pilot to learning what kind of restraint leadership entails. It almost feels like he’s being groomed by Leia to be a future leader in the Resistance, and their boss/employee but also mother/son-ish relationship is interesting. It’s nice to see Leia forming relationships with other characters — unlike The Force Awakens, which wasted Carrie Fisher’s potential by basically making her Han’s ex-wife and not letting her be a character on her own. She really delivers in this movie and her early loss and thus absence from the next film is such a tragedy that I can’t even process it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Poe doesn’t trust authority and makes rash decisions. Ok. Then this plot kind of goes bonkers, but in a kind of fun way, with Poe growing suspicious that purple-hair Laura Dern is too incompetent to really save the Resistance and even going so far as to carry out a mutiny. Internal fighting within the Resistance in the face of their extinction makes sense and is interesting, and I think we were supposed to see that Poe was once again making a knee-jerk decision without really thinking it through. But it comes off fairly extreme, and I struggled to believe that Leia and Holdo would be so calm about his mutiny once it was all over. “Oh, that lovable scamp, he backstabbed the entire chain of command and almost got us all killed, I like him.” Leia has always had a thing for bad boys, but come on. She slapped him across the face for less earlier in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at least it feels like the Poe/Holdo’s storyline matters to the overall plot. What did Finn and Rose actually accomplish with their whole escapade? Really, the only thing they accomplished is inspiring the slave children on Canto Bight, which Rian Johnson and the movie seem to be suggesting made the whole thing worth it. And on an allegorical level, I appreciate that. But film-making wise it felt like an afterthought,  a bit like a consolation prize to reassure us that this subplot was important. I think this is where the movie gets my harshest critique, but I don’t want to dwell on it too much. In many ways it more than made up for this weak storyline with strong choices in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to element #3: genre and tone. Apart from the strange deviation of Canto Bight, the movie feels like an epic fairy tale in all the best ways. It (mostly) knows it’s fantasy, and not science fiction. The core arcs and tone are (in general) there. The flashback sequences telling us the backstory between Luke and Ben are filmed in a dream-like, magical style, like something out of the Lord of the Rings. The highly stylized interpretation of that memory — the shadows on Luke’s face, the close-up on Ben’s fear-filled eyes, the implosion of the hut as Luke screams out to try to fix this misunderstanding, to undo what he’s done… gah, it was just perfect. PERFECT. I wanted to stand up and applaud. The campiness of Leia’s sudden space resurrection admittedly gets a bit cringe-y on a re-watch. But it was such a shocking turn of events that I barely had time to process it at the time, I was too busy trying to convince myself that I was actually seeing what I was seeing. I’m rarely surprised in movies these days, so that was fun. And it was trying to be magical and mythical and majestic and fantastical, the way Star Wars should be. So however hokey the execution (I think it was mostly filmed to a be a spectacle in the 3D version) I still applaud the attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of tone, The Last Jedi succeeds because it delves into heavy subject matter and attempt operatic, epic themes while still not taking itself too seriously and retaining some of the campy playfulness that made the original trilogy so much fun. It’s the first Star Wars film in ages in which the parts that were funny were pretty much genuinely funny and not awkward or cringe-inducing (The Force Awakens had some success at this as well, another reason it ended up working as a film for me despite its flaws). That sense of humor might have been the MOST disturbing thing missing from Rogue One, which was uniformly angsty, and plays a large part of making the tone of Star Wars so familiar and comforting. How could a movie this dark still make me laugh this much? It’s great. Luke being grumpy with Rey while trying to train her was the best — give me a whole movie of that please — and even elements I had been a bit nervous about going in (the Porgs, for example) never overstayed their welcome. I did not feel like the humor was thrown in for the 6 year olds in the audience and catering directly to their level, as I did through all of the prequels. Most of the humor involved and deepened the characters involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To even throw in humor between Rey and Kylo Ren, that’s bold and exciting. “I’d really rather not do this right now,” Rey says. Kylo’s droll, sighing response, “Yeah… me either.” He’s getting dressed after showering off the blood from his latest rampage, one assumes. It’s inconvenient timing for the both of them, and that’s funny. That humor lets the silliness of the whole thing, the whole franchise, breathe and settle and stop from becoming the cringe-inducing mess that the prequels were. You cannot take this too seriously (listen up, fanboys). But the humor has to be earned and it has to be actually funny. I don’t know why exasperated space nuns clicking their tongues at a horrified and embarrassed Rey is so funny to me. But it was.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus we arrive (at last) at element #4: unique use of myth and allegory. If the original trilogy was Luke’s coming-of-age story mythologized, and the prequels are (I guess) Anakin’s tragedy, then this new trilogy appears set to be a kind of blend of the two. We are given two parallel figures in Rey and Poe, the one ascending as she comes of age into adulthood and wisdom, the other sinking further and further into desperation and despair. Both tales mirror that of myths and legends told by humanity since like forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This film gave us Rey’s counterpart to Luke’s trial in the cave, her descent into the dark grotto and vision there. A literal descent is a key part of the hero’s journey — often depicted in myths as a cave, as with Luke on Dagobah, or a fall, as when Luke plummets into the abyss on Bespin. Here Rey drops down into dark water and approaches a mirror-like surface, in which she becomes convinced she will see her parents. Instead, she sees only herself reflected infinitely into the unknown. This is a bit more obscure symbolism than Luke seeing his own face in Darth Vader’s mask, but its definitely running in a similar vein, and the grotto is definitely the same kind of place of dark power and knowledge like the cave of Dagobah. When Luke asks Yoda what is inside the cave, Yoda replies, “Only what you take with you.” This is the revelation of these places of darkness, that they show you yourself - they do not answer the question you come in asking, but the deeper question you didn’t even think to ask. Where Luke sought to find the truth of his enemy and was instead shown the truth of himself, Rey seeks to know the truth of her story, her parentage, only to be shown herself, just herself, as far as the eye can see. There are a lot of ways to interpret this, but one interpretation I like is that this foreshadows the revelation that her parents were nobody important. She comes to this place of dark wisdom she is shown an intimation of the truth that she’s afraid to face, the same truth that Maz Kanata tried in a more gentle way to give her in the previous film: that her conviction that her family will return and give her life meaning is a fairy tale, and she has only herself. She is all she has, and all she needs. The line of infinite clones of herself suggests she is part of a great unending chain of life, or even the next in an unending chain of Jedi who give tangible presence to the living Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, the mythic use of the Force in the film was a welcome change in a franchise where it has become little more than a superpower that makes Jedi and Sith super badass. The original films maintain an aura of mystery, of almost religious mysticism around the Force, of which the powers of a Jedi are only a dim reflection, not the sum. It was a little disappointing to only get one session from Luke instructing Rey, but at least it was really really good. When he asks her what the Force is, she replies in much the way many fans would - its a cool power that makes a Jedi do cool stuff. Luke snorts derisively, as well he should. What follows is a meditation on mysticism that is mirrored in many world religions, a communion with the awesome totality of creation, of life, of the power and energy that dwells in all things, even (and here is the part of crucial revelation) in you. Life and death, light and darkness, creation and destruction, all dwell inside you with the same power that they exist in all the universe. It is the Jedi’s wisdom to recognize this and be open to it, so that these forces may be balanced inside her soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get very annoyed by extended universe discussions of “grey Jedi,” Force users who walk the fine line between the Light and Dark side. This idea grows out of a perception of the Force in the framework of a very western good/evil dichotomy: there is the Light Force and the Dark Force, and these are in total opposition. We instinctively know that this is a simplistic view of something mystical, so it’s easy to become interested in figures who transcend the good/evil opposition and find a balance in both. The problem with this view of grey Jedi is that this is exactly what the Jedi are supposed to be, figures who find balance in the Force within themselves. The Jedi are monks and not priests. The films do not refer to the “Light side” because there is no Light side. There is only the Force. The “Dark side” is an imbalance, a fascination with and addiction to only part of what the Force is. Luke is disturbed by Rey’s immediate fixation on the dark place on the island not because she’s supposed to repudiate it and avoid it forever, but because such immediate interest suggests her soul is already imbalanced, her interest in the darkness already out of proportion. He’s seen that before, and it did not end well. The film’s meditation on the inherent duality of the Force is exactly on target with the original intention of the early films and only underscores the relationship between Rey and Ben, who are figures of “light” and “darkness” intertwined with each other much like the yin and yang.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mystery of the Force and the Jedi is furthered by Yoda’s visit to Luke — what a treat to have the real Yoda back, the trickster god, the mystic who laughs with maniacal laughter born of his inner wisdom. The “destruction” of the Jedi texts is a symbolic act straight out of myth, weighty with meaning. Luke in his anger wishes to destroy the Jedi’s legacy, only seeing his own failure with Ben reflected throughout Jedi history. Amused, Yoda destroys them first. The texts, Yoda reminds Luke, don’t matter in and of themselves. The books themselves are not holy (pay attention, Bible literalists!) but only the truths to which the books point. The truth of the Force stands beyond the tradition of the Jedi. It doesn’t live in the past at all, but it is always now, constantly reborn, refreshed, taking new forms, but always the same. Not only does this have weighty religious symbolism, but it also almost feels like Yoda is teaching us a lesson about Star Wars itself. All the details you memorized and the lore you’ve accumulated mean nothing, Yoda tells us, the magic is not in those things. You have confused the books ABOUT the Force for the Force itself.  And in this teaching Yoda reveals himself as the Zen master he was always meant to be — not the suddenly wild and wacky lightsaber dueler the prequels made him out to be. Yoda is the soul of the Jedi — and he knows more than anyone that “war does not make one great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Rey’s story is cut from the cloth of coming-of-age myths and Luke’s from Zen-like meditations on the meaning of truth, Ben Solo’s is drawn from mythic tragedies. He is flawed, he is wounded, he is suffering, and from this is born his desperate need to control the galaxy and be feared and obeyed. Fans who have come to really like Sith characters in the movies because they are “so cool” have largely found themselves disappointed with Kylo Ren, because here (at last!) we have a character whose villainy is not idealized or romanticized. He is, in fact, utterly pathetic. The harder he tries to become evil and powerful, the more we can see that he’s nothing but a “boy in a mask.” The consequences of his actions are still terrifying and heart-breaking, but all the more so because we know at the heart of the monster is just a wounded child. Whenever he reaches out, whenever he opens up, he only digs himself further into dysfunction and violence. There’s no easy answer to how to save Ben Solo. Can he be saved? How would you even try? Rey’s hopes that she could do so are quickly dashed. This is a thorny moral dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I can think of no character more symbolically fitting for our times, for the echoes of Kylo Ren are in angry, fragile young men ALL AROUND US. Many interpretations of the film and the character speak of the echoes of white fragility and toxic masculinity made manifest. This is a myth, but a myth for our time so fitting that I found it electrifying. So much remains to be seen, but I have very high expectations for how this character’s arc is brought to its final conclusion, how the myth ends.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in conclusion, basically, I feel like the Last Jedi had its heart in the right place. Like many others, I am critical of some of the plot lines and lament the lost opportunities when it comes to some key characters like Finn and Poe. But the movie succeeds to one degree or another in each of the four key Star Wars elements that matter to me, and so in the end I give it a thumbs up. Grade B for execution, but A+ for effort. It felt electric, it felt new and familiar at once, and it made me feel like a kid watching Star Wars again. I have a lot of thoughts about it, as you have read, but during the film I was not thinking these things. I was staring at the screen, wide-eyed with wonder the way I always was every damn time I watched The Empire Strikes Back as a child. In a world where nostalgia is cynically manufactured and commercialized all of the time, that kind of actual bringing-me-back magic is worth its weight in gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not a film that merely celebrates what we loved about the past. It is current and it looks wildly ahead towards a glorious future. And for the first time I started to think that maybe, just maybe, Star Wars has a meaningful path forward as a franchise and pop-culture touchstone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until I saw the Solo trailer. Ugghhhhhh. Two steps forward, one step back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What I Wish Someone Had Told Me When I Was Learning to Code]]></title><description><![CDATA[Some words of encouragement to anybody beginning the journey of learning to make computers do what you want them to do.]]></description><link>https://matthaws.github.io/the-blog/posts/What-I-Wish-Someone-Had-Said/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://matthaws.github.io/the-blog/posts/What-I-Wish-Someone-Had-Said/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2017 22:12:03 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s going to be very easy to get discouraged. But you aren’t alone!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning to code will be both easier and harder than you think. That sounds like mystical mumbo jumbo, but it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are learning a kind of language. Just like learning a new human language, there will be culture shock. You will want to run away back to familiar things, but you’ll never learn if you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will feel dumb. You will think you are the only person who ever felt dumb while learning to code. You will think people who know how to code have some kind of magic powers that you just don’t have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no magic powers. Professional coders felt the same way as you do when they were learning. They still feel dumb sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your code doesn’t run without bugs on the first try, you do not suck at coding and it doesn’t mean everything you wrote is worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will never reach a level of skill in which you will always just magically write bug-free code. You will never reach a point in working with code in which you do not have to deal with bugs. Instead, you will get better at tracking down, spotting, and fixing bugs through time and practice, and a lot of staring at your code in confusion. Developing efficient debugging skills is more important than stressing over writing “perfect” code on your first try.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    
&lt;figcaption&gt;A large part of the process.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get something to work, go back and make sure you understand why it wasn’t running before. Be very specific. Make a note of it. Understanding why code breaks is key to helping you more reliably know how code works. If you just move on because it’s working, it will take you a lot longer to learn things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code with other people who are learning to code. You’ll learn both from their experience and by teaching them what you know. You will see that other people are struggling too. Tell each other that it’s okay, and that you are getting this. Remind each other that this can be hard, and neither of you are dumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any language, there are conventions and common practices in coding. Learning these will help you to communicate more easily with other people who speak this language. Like any language, sometimes these conventions will feel arbitrary or illogical. Learn them anyway. One day, maybe, you can be a voice in the community to argue for changes in conventions. But for now you will be for better served by learning and adopting convention then you will be by immediately challenging or resisting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the professional world, coding is not a solitary activity. It is a social and collaborative, done by teams of people working closely together. Learn to be flexible. Understand that there’s usually no one right way. Practice talking about code and explaining what the code is doing to other people. Learn to write your code in a way that is easy for other people to read. When assigning names, give names that make sense and represent what the thing is or does. Look up spacing, indentation, and naming conventions for the language you are learning and follow them — they are designed to make your code more readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll see code online that looks flashy because it shortens a whole algorithm into one compact line that is almost impossible for the human mind to parse and would be incredibly difficult to debug. You will be tempted to think that this is what professional coders do and that this should be your goal. It is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your code will not run a lot of the time. You will have error after error after error. It will take you hours to get a simple thing to work. If you see this as failure, you will be exhausted and demoralized very quickly. This is why a lot of people who try to learn to code give up. If, instead, you see the process of getting your code to work as an exciting challenge or puzzle and celebrate wildly when it finally works, you are already on your way to being a great programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing code requires patience with yourself. Coding without losing your mind will require being kind to yourself and giving yourself positive reinforcement. The computer will not reassure you that you are doing well or that you were close that time, it will only tell you that your code didn’t work. It will be up to you to pat yourself on the back for steps forward and make the most of every success and to seek out companions on this crazy journey who will help encourage you. If you do not do this, you will burn out, give up, and convince yourself that you simply cannot code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story?]]></title><description><![CDATA[As a life-long Star Wars fan AND somebody who really overthinks movies, Rogue One really bothered me.

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of Rogue One has caused a sharp rift through the Star Wars fans, certainly through the small community of Star Wars fans with whom I am most directly connected. For some, this is one of the best Star Wars films ever, in the ranks with the original trilogy (or at least very close to it), and for others it was sort of a boring mess. Thus, to an even greater extent than The Force Awakens about a year ago, this film has provoked reactions from various fans that are stark and clashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this fascinating. Star Wars is such a cultural touchstone for my generation that it has become a sort of universal connection — you can always count on meeting people who like Star Wars, who are even enthusiastic about it, and being able to bond over that shared love. It’s a passion that has linked me to countless other men and women, and helped me form friendships with strangers by providing common ground. For all these decades we fans were in such agreement that Star Wars is awesome that it faded in the cultural zeitgeist, unquestioned and unexamined. Many of us continued to be enthusiastic die-hards, even when we hadn’t even seen the original trilogy in many years. Even with the release of the prequels, fans were largely united in their opinion: they sucked. Thus it has been easy for me to think of Star Wars as something that brings fans together in agreement as a unified, cohesive body. It is a universal good. If you grew up with it and loved it like I did, then we are totally on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Force Awakens rattled that unity. Rogue One has shattered it. What we have come to discover is that all these years we were all saying how much we loved Star Wars without realizing that what each of us loved about the films and franchise varied wildly from person to person. The new movies have each catered to different sets of expectations and tastes, and suddenly we have two fans, equal in their ardor for the franchise, disagreeing over not just if a film was good but whether it could properly even be considered Star Wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which begs the question, then, what is Star Wars? Do we all have a different perception of it completely? What if anything did we ever agree on about it? And I guess most importantly, What is Star Wars to me? And what does that say about me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that, I can pinpoint (in a general sense) what I want from future Star Wars films. And I can explain why Rogue One is exactly what I feared the new films would be, indeed the very embodiment of everything I do not want the franchise to become.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;SO WHAT IS STAR WARS, ANYWAY?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Star Wars film was an unexpected, surprising success. While it contained many familiar components, there had never really been anything like it. Much has been said about it — it created the very idea of the summer blockbuster, it changed the movie industry, it redefined a genre, etc. etc. Much of the audience’s initial fascination with the movie was with its technical achievements, and it won a number of special effects Oscars the following year. However, the movies are still beloved today, when their special effects seem quaint and primitive. So is film-making innovation enough to explain the enduring success of the original Star Wars trilogy? I don’t think so — there’s something special about it, something that sets it apart from the ranks of other action-adventure technologically innovative blockbusters that have come and gone on our screens since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that it is the original trilogy of films that launched the franchise and defined its unique and endearing qualities, I will be using them for comparison extensively in my critique of Rogue One. By doing so I will already be on a different wavelength than many fans of the new film, for it has become clear in my discussions with my friends that, for some fans, there’s a feeling that Star Wars has come a long way since those original moves and needs to continue to progress in new and different directions. They feel that if we remain fixed on the past success of those original films we will never create anything new or innovative, but instead merely rehash the same old stuff over and over and the franchise will go stale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting argument. I certainly share the desire to keep the franchise fresh and compelling. If we really have to make more Star Wars movies, then, yes, let’s make good ones. And thus Rogue One (especially as the first non-saga “side” film in the franchise) becomes a fascinating test case of some fundamental creative questions. How much can you change of the original formula and distinctive qualities of the fictional universe that the original trilogy created before we are no longer in the same franchise? Is it enough to simply retain some of the surface elements to make something a part of the Star Wars universe? To make a Star Wars movie, is it enough just to reference a bunch of other Star Wars movies? Or does the heart of what makes Star Wars special and distinct, what in fact makes it Star Wars, exist in something beyond just those surface details?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my view, the essential qualities of Star Wars are, broadly speaking, heroic characters, allegorical plot, unique genre, and use of myth. By examining the original trilogy and Rogue One in these terms, I will make a case for what those first three movies did really well so that we can see by contrast where Rogue One faltered or was misguided. We will try to uncover the qualities that made Star Wars special and has made it endure, and thus understand what it is we lose when we abandon them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;HEROIC CHARACTERS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The startling success of Star Wars as films served as the perfect delivery system for what lay at the story’s core — the redecoration and reimagining of mythic archetypes and arcs that are as old as humanity itself. Myths are the allegorical stories we tell ourselves to make sense of our own existence, to wrestle with the experience of being alive. Myth appears in every culture that has ever existed on the planet, appearing in religion, in folklore, in stories passed down from generation to generation, serving as a kind of symbolic mirror through which we can understand our own life journeys. Myth contains the wisdom of countless generations that have lived and died before us. Renowned professor, writer, and thinker Joseph Campbell made it his life’s work to study the core of every culture’s mythology where there are common themes and messages universal to all mankind. In his writings and teachings, Campbell distilled those common threads down to their essence. George Lucas was intensely interested in the work of Joseph Campbell, who he at least once referred to as “my Yoda.” Campbell, in turn, is reported to have said that Lucas was his best student. And he adored the Star Wars trilogy, which he watched for the first time all in one day near the end of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for all of my many critiques of George Lucas, which could fill an essay of their own, I have to give him this credit: he understood (at one point in his career at least) the purpose and power of myth. And one of the first steps in crafting a new version of an old myth, one that suited his times, was creating characters who would stand out vividly in our imagination, who would take root deeply in our hearts, so that we would be emotionally invested in the allegorical journey that they undergo. All of the characters in the original films have a familiar-yet-new quality, because they are new twists on ancient archetypes. The film is constructed such that we understand them immediately. We know their strengths and weaknesses. They are roughly drawn characters, sure, like those in a myth or fairy tale, but they are understandable and instantly familiar. The sassy but idealistic princess. The skilled but selfish mercenary. The wise teacher haunted by failure. And, most recognizable of all, the naive young hero, trapped in childhood, setting out on his symbolic quest towards enlightenment and adulthood. The psychological nature of archetypes, which represent aspects of the subconscious, of human nature (i.e., our own nature), makes them relatable and believable. They feel like our friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to their likability? Well, for one thing, they are flawed. They are occasionally even ridiculous. They squabble. They make big, comic mistakes. They bumble their way through and succeed as often through luck as through skill. And, yes, they display great moments of strength and courage in difficult circumstances. And that makes it all the more thrilling and fun, because we know these people aren’t all-powerful and we are rooting for them to succeed against the more obviously powerful forces arrayed against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For another thing, they have genuine connection with each other. The movie takes time to develop their interactions so that we believe in their deepening bond. Luke, Leia, and Han actually share little screen time all together in A New Hope. And yet in those sparse moments we get a whole range of both positive and negative interactions, and we see them forced to work together to overcome adversity. And thus in the final sequence, the award ceremony, we totally believe that they have become a kind of family unit, a team, on this adventure. This is because the film manages to display action while also developing character bonds, and if it ever has to choose between the two it does the latter. The characters bicker and give their point of view during firefights(“This is some rescue!”). Luke and Han interact in character while attempting to shoot down the pursuing TIE Fighter (“Great, kid, don’t get cocky!”), etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they change. At the end of each movie the core characters have been forever altered in some way. By the end of the trilogy they have completed major symbolic arcs. The changes they go through have allegorical meaning that resonate beyond their fictional context, but they are still totally believable within that context. And we were with them every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Force Awakens, for all its flaws, presents us with characters who are at least in the right ballpark. The characters are likeable and form genuine bonds on their journey. They care about each other, and we understand why. They are flawed and occasionally ridiculous. They don’t take themselves too seriously. They are skilled but still display weakness. And by the end of the film they have changed profoundly. Whether they have interesting and believable overall arcs remains to be seen in the next two installments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The characters in Rogue One serve narrative functions, but I can’t really tell you much about their personality. I didn’t even really catch their names; I had to look them up after. Jyn is the jaded, tight-lipped, and badass female lead. Cassian is the jaded, tight-lipped, and badass male lead. Chirrut (the Force monk guy) is less jaded, perhaps, but still mostly tight-lipped and badass. His husband Baze is definitely jaded, tight-lipped, and badass. And the droid is wise-cracking but — seeing the theme yet? — still jaded and badass. We know that they are all badass because they are very good at killing stormtroopers in a very dramatic way. They are killing machines, in fact, displaying incredible skill in combat. I mean, for most of the movie, defeating their enemies doesn’t even look that hard. They don’t need me to root for them, they are doing just fine. Their skill level is all uniformly high - which, to me, is boring. This does not make them great characters, just great warriors. And war, says Master Yoda, does not make one great. If that combat prowess and gritty gumption is stripped away, their personalities are so similar, so uniformly humorless and angsty, that I’d be hard pressed to describe to you the differences between most of the characters beyond describing their job. The prequels suffered from a similar problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The characters also never really connect because the movie never gives them time to form relationships in any kind of likeable or organic way. This is partly a pacing and genre problem, which I get to below, but it’s also a problem with the characters themselves. Because what would these characters really have to say to each other anyway, given the chance? They don’t really even seem to like each other. I’ve had to work in an office with a group of people I didn’t particularly care for, and our conversations were much like how the Rogue team talk to each other: Let’s just get the job done, but you aren’t my friend. That’s a fine place to start if the characters grow to like each other. The movie behaves as though they do, because they are sad when they have to part later on, but I certainly didn’t see that bond happen. I had to take the movie’s word for it that they became friends, as it feels like they cut out a couple key character bonding moments. The movie consistently chooses focusing on action over building character relationships. Jyn and Cassian fight their way through Jeddha without saying a word to each other or giving us any kind of emotional point of view on what’s going on. It’s a long, long action sequence in which we see plenty of demonstrations that everybody is badass but no time at all is spent on developing the characters or their connection. The closest thing to that is Cassian’s shocked and surprised face when Jyn takes out a bunch of stormtroopers using just some extendable antenna thing. He’s somewhat impressed. There’s your character interaction, now back to the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A kind of antagonism is artificially built up between Jyn and K2 in a few lines, and at least their relationship takes a small arc during the movie as K2 grudgingly comes to respect her. But absent any other genuine human interaction in the movie this felt, to me, highly insufficient for us to come to love any of the characters involved. Cassian and Jyn mostly just yell at each other, and it’s not even sexy yelling like between Han and Leia. I was jarred by the sudden suggestion of romantic feelings at the end. Like, wait, what? Han and Leia’s sexual tension was clearly built up over several scenes of flirtation and verbal sparring. Cassian and Jyn just fight over his mission to kill her father. Do we feel that because they are opposite gendered characters there is no other possible resolution to their story before they blow up but to fall in love? It has to be romantic all of the sudden? They’ve known each other for, like, a day. It’s unearned, and it feels cheap. Frankly, Finn and Poe have a better romantic arc than these two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And none of these characters change in any fundamental way by the end of the movie. Jyn’s entire arc is “I don’t want to help the Rebellion, it has nothing to do with me,” to, suddenly, “I’m willing to give my life for this cause now!” There’s a change there, I guess, but very little fuss is made over it. It just sort of happens. Cassian’s arc starts with “I really want to help the Rebellion” and progresses to “I really, REALLY want to help the Rebellion!” And that’s a shame because Cassian is actually potentially interesting - he’s committed horrible crimes in the service of the greater good of this cause so if the Rebellion falls apart he is terrified he will just be a bad person. Too bad the movie doesn’t really want to spend any time dwelling on this struggle other than to give him one speech about it where he basically just spells it out for us, then we move on. But there’s something to him, at least. His unquestioned loyalty to the Rebellion is put to the test when he is given orders he can’t fully bring himself to follow, so he has an internal struggle. Wow, an internal struggle! Thank the Maker! Unfortunately, it’s a little thin as the movie never takes even a few minutes from the endless action scenes to actually develop it. All in all, Cassian, to me, is the closest thing to an interesting character here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even some of my friends who loved the movie admit that many of the characters are boring, Jyn Urso in particular. You would think, given that she’s supposedly the main character, that this would be a problem. Her relationship with Saw is key to the whole plot, but it’s a relationship that happens entirely off-screen so that we have to take everybody’s word for it that it’s very important. Her relationship with her father never goes beyond the surface level of what you would expect (more on this in the next section). Her romance with Cassian comes sort of out of nowhere. She’s given canned cliche speeches that are delivered flatly, clashing against the stirring underscoring music trying to convince us that something dramatic is happening. There’s just not a lot to her. But individual characters, I am told, aren’t really the point here. The Rebellion itself, and the Rogue team as a unit, are the main characters. So…why did we spend the first twenty minutes learning Jyn’s backstory then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there’s Director whats-his-face… Yeah, there’s just not much to say about him. He’s a bad guy. Okay, fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, look, there’s some of the original characters! Grand Moff Tarkin is back. And Darth Vader! That’s exciting right? I mean, yes, maybe it could be if the movie didn’t self-consciously reach out and smack you and say: Hey look its Darth Vader, you love him don’t you? Here he is! And here he is choking a guy! You love when he chokes a guy, don’t you? And here he is punning about how he’s choking the guy, and showing us his hand in the choking-the-guy gesture! Same with Bail Organa. I was thrilled to see Jimmy Smits appear, since he’s a great actor woefully under-used in the prequels, which gave him flat, boring scenes with flat, boring lines. Unfortunately, so did Rogue One, only it added the dimension of wink wink inside reference wink wink. As a Star Wars fan, I appreciated seeing him and Mon Mothma and General Dodonna, since (unlike some of the other character cameos) it made narrative sense for them to be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the strength of the cast has to rest on the new core characters with whom the movie spends most of its time, not on callbacks to the previous movies, and those characters disappoint for all the reasons I have discussed above. We may disagree on some of the following points because we will disagree on what kind of movie Rogue One can or should have been. But no matter what kind of movie it is, shouldn’t it have interesting, loveable characters with whom we relate because they show us genuine emotion and interesting flaws? I mean without that…what’s the point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just the plot, I guess. And about that…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;ALLEGORICAL PLOT&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As action adventure space operas, the Star Wars movies always have a lot of plot. We’re always desperate to get the thing to stop the thing and save the galaxy. But why do we care about the fate of this abstract, fictional galaxy? What energizes the urgency of these fictional circumstances so that we get invested in getting the thing to stop the thing? Hint: it’s not more explosions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original trilogy, there is a mythic, allegorical understructure to these plot points that keeps us invested. We are constantly asked to divide our attention between the epic (the struggle between the Empire and the Rebellion) and the personal (the struggle for the soul of the Skywalkers). This works because, ultimately, they are one and the same conflict, each serving as a symbol of the other. Drawing on the work of Joseph Campbell, Lucas endowed the arc of the original trilogy with elements of the hero’s journey that have appeared in the action-adventures humanity has told for countless generations. Like many of those myths, the progression of the Rebellion and the journey of Luke Skywalker ultimately serve as a symbolic representation of something deeply personal and relatable for all of us - the trials and tribulations we all inevitably face, and the journey from childhood to adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke starts the trilogy as a child. That’s why he’s so annoying. He sees the world in black and white. Darth Vader is the personification of evil and that’s all he needs to know. A New Hope is a fairy tale, a story with simplistic morality because it’s told through a child’s eyes, in which the hero takes his first steps into the unknown and beyond his previously conceived limitations. In The Empire Strikes Back, he moves into adolescence. He is overly confident in his newfound strength and insists that he is ready to plumb the deeper mysteries. His confidence is shattered by a huge revelation, first hinted within the dark cave on Dagobah. When presented with a vision of his ultimate enemy, Luke does what feels right - he strikes it down. That’s what you do with evil, right? You vanquish it. However, within the mask is not a monster, but his own face. But he does not understand what Yoda is trying to teach him. The revelation doesn’t strike him in full force until later when Darth Vader reveals their connection. Now the evil is not some faceless other, it is his own flesh and blood. And this is the lesson that myths so often teach the hero (and thus us): that the evil you hate and want to destroy is not out there somewhere, it’s here, in you. Now his quest seems hopeless, for he is his own enemy. He flees from the revelation, he literally plummets downward and hits the low point of the journey. In the final chapter, he has through bitter experience come to accept that there is darkness inside of himself. He even appears in Return of the Jedi wearing all black, showing that over the course of the trilogy we have come to subvert the simplistic color symbolism set up in the first movie, just as Luke’s perception of good and evil has been subverted. His new, more nuanced understanding of morality has changed everything about his relationship to his enemy. He has learned that if the evil of Darth Vader is in Luke Skywalker, then the good of Luke Skywalker must exist somewhere in Darth Vader. He seeks out his father not to destroy him but to offer himself as the mirror in which his father might see his true self — just as the father had been the mirror for his own revelation. He is tempted and pushed, but in the end he triumphs — not by defeating Vader in combat or outsmarting him (as would happen, I think, in almost any other mainstream franchise), but by refusing to fight him, by throwing away his blade. And at that moment he is at peace with himself, he has become an adult. He has become a Jedi. The moral of the story, the myth’s core, is that it is only that surrender—never brute force—which can awaken Anakin Skywalker from within Darth Vader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is huge, epic stuff. This is the stuff of legend and myth — and what I have sketched out above is only one possible way to interpret the richly symbolic action of the three films. The plot resonates with meaning beyond the fictional context of the story, and that’s why we care about getting the thing that stops the thing. We know instinctively that this is about more than just the fate of some fictional galaxy. The war, the conflict, means something; it is not just blindly championed as being awesome. The action is never just an end unto itself. Even if this is never consciously identified by much of its audience, this deeper meaning is instrumental to what has made the original Star Wars trilogy so unique among mainstream franchises and what has kept it relevant long after its technological achievements no longer impress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is lots of action, tons of it. Star Wars is characterized by those thrilling fast-paced action sequences. However, the story is also willing to slow down now and then to give us moments of wonder and introspection, iconic images of stillness and reflection that break up the action a little bit to add an epic, operatic texture to the fabric of the tale. Think of Luke staring with longing angst at the double sunset on Tatooine, the music swelling. Think of his awe and speechless wonder when Yoda lifts his X-Wing out of the bog. And think of his quiet grief as he watches his father’s body burn on the moon of Endor. Every now and then, in the midst of the lasers and explosions, the movies dare to be still, to reflect, and let a few simple images set to beautiful music communicate everything. These moments counter-balance the fast-paced action sequences and thereby enhance them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, The Force Awakens at least tried to do all this. It wants to be myth, it wants to have allegorical moments. It does this, as we all know, by attempting parallelism with the plot of A New Hope, but because nothing obvious is communicated or illuminated by those parallels it lapses into rote plagiarism instead. But the movie has (sometimes forced) mystical, mythic moments. There’s an fairy tale quality to much of it, and that’s something I had given up hope for ever seeing in a Star Wars movie again. And there are iconic visuals and moments of quiet reflection and meditation, though not much—it’s too much to hope in modern adventure films that things can pause to take a breath for more than ten seconds here or there, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kylo Ren is one of the only characters added to the franchise since Return of the Jedi who has the potential to have an arc that truly fits into the mythology of Star Wars. He’s a fantastic inversion of Luke, a young man trying desperately to be evil and to repress any other part of his soul. Like Luke, he must face his father, face who he really is — only Ben Solo chooses to kill his father in the hope that this will free him from his father’s legacy and allow him to be the powerful evil lord that he so desperately wants to be. He is the anti-Luke, starting at the opposite place and making the opposite choice. He resonates with deep symbolic meaning for our time, a young man full of anger trying desperately to quench his more sensitive, sympathetic nature to fulfill the hard-edged expectation of what he feels he is supposed to be. He buries his insecurities with a false show of strength. We all have known Kylo Rens; hell, some of us have been him. It will be fascinating to see where they take this character. It’s difficult to know if interesting arcs are in store for Rey and Finn, but the potential is there. It’s hard to make a full assessment until we get at least one more movie. Episode VIII will go a long way towards revealing if, for example, Rey’s precociously fast command of the Force is part of her overall story arc or just lazy storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to see any place in Rogue One that aspires to the level of allegory or myth. But this may be an unfair critique. I don’t think it wanted to do so. It was trying to be a very different kind of movie. But I think something vital is lost without that element. The surface elements of the plot were all there (we need to get the thing to stop the thing) but… why should we care? Especially since, this being a prequel, we already know how it ends. There is no symbolic journey for the characters. There can be no allegorical revelation because nobody changes in any profound way, unless you count dying in the service of the cause. There is mythic ground to be covered regarding self-sacrifice that the movie flirts with but never quite manages. Its attention is too focused on the action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a surface-level nod to the themes of the saga. The pivotal relationship in the film (apparently) is again between a father and a child. Jyn has tried to forget her father after he’s taken/abandons her, then she gets a message from him that changes her opinion of him, and then, conveniently, also gets to see him in person right before he dies to tell him that. That confrontation, I guess, changes her in that now she’s committed to defeat the Empire to…honor his legacy? Revenge his death? Muddying the waters is her other parent/mentor, the other one that the plot also hinges on, Saw Gerrerra. They have a complicated past, I guess. It’s not clear. He basically raised her, but they don’t say much to each other when they finally meet that helps us believe there is real affection there. And then, because of that relationship which is barely established, we are evidently supposed to care (given the dramatic music and posturing during that scene) about his pointless sacrifice: “It’s okay, Jyn, leave me, I am just feeling like it’s time for me to die now. I’m not even gonna try to escape with you even though there is clearly time for me to get on the ship. There’s really no valid plot reason for me to die right now other than there’s nothing else, apparently, for my character to do.” The movie spent no time giving us an emotional connection to him, and his death does nothing to help the heroes on their journey or propel the plot. Why bother casting Forest Whitaker if you aren’t going even use him for anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all balls-to-the-wall action. The film does not give itself a single moment of introspection or stillness to explore beyond the barest surface level the deeper themes that motivate the conflict or the human emotions that are caught up in it all. I know this is essentially a kids movie, it doesn’t have to be super deep all the time. But the original trilogy proves that you can be deep and really fun at the same time. Rogue One doesn’t have time to even try. It moves with breakneck speed from action set piece to action set piece, so many explosions in sequence that they begin to lose all meaning in a general wash of violence and urgency and action and go go go go go. GET THE THING TO STOP THE THING BECAUSE…. WELL JUST BECAUSE.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;UNIQUE GENRE&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major purposes of myth, Campbell writes, is to provide a roadmap for life, particularly for those huge moments of transition that all of us face eventually. One of these fundamental transitions is the passing from childhood to adulthood, a transition so profound and complicated that coming-of-age stories are still prevalent in every form of literature and art. So too do they symbolically dominate much of world mythology. A culture’s myths and coming-of-age rituals guide a child into adulthood. There is an aching need for this kind of myth today. Campbell believed that many problems in our society arise from the lack of any cohesive coming-of-age ritual or mythology in our modern culture. But we long for the guidance it would provide and feel the hollowness of the void its absence leaves in us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many of us, this void has been filled with genre fiction, particularly fantasy. This popular genre has long been widely misunderstood by the mainstream public. It has some cred now, what with Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones becoming part of the mainstream, but it was not taken seriously for many, many years and still raises an eyebrow with some. Considered nothing but children’s stories, pure pulp and escapism, those who do not read it cannot fathom why anybody over the age of 12 would want to read about hobbits trying to destroy a ring. But escapism is the very least of fantasy’s attractions. The genre taps into folklore and myth, and by doing so tells the symbolic, allegorical stories that mankind has always told. The passion the genre evokes comes not just because the stories are “fun” but because they fulfill an aching, existential mythical need that we didn’t even know we had - the symbolic, artistic representation of growing up, of facing adult life and adult responsibilities, of confronting loss, sorrow, and death. It’s not an accident that so many fantasy fans become enamored of the genre around the beginning of adolescence, nor that so many fantasy novels are also coming of age stories that mirror the heroic arcs of ancient mythology. Their fantastical settings allow them to hint at a deeper truth. Fantasy has the potential to actually be more about real life than any novel set in the real world, by doing what all myths do: removing the trappings of our day-to-day life and, by putting humanity into a fictional/mythical imaginative context, revealing something fundamental about us that is separate from all that. That is, in fact, the whole point of the archetypal hero’s journey - leaving behind the day to day reality, traveling into darkness and mystery, and returning changed. By going on that journey, we change too. Such is the power from which fantasy draws its appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m dwelling on fantasy here, and not science fiction, for a simple reason: Star Wars is not science fiction. I assumed for many years that we were all on the same page about this and that it went without saying. However, my discussions with many about Rogue One suggest otherwise. The movie itself is pretty solid proof that a great many people do not agree with me on this. Since this disagreement might be the most fundamental divide between those who loved Rogue One and those of us who didn’t, I’m going to write that again, and I’ll even put it in all caps in indicate how crucial of a point that I think it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STAR WARS IS NOT SCIENCE FICTION. It is fantasy, as much of a textbook fantasy as anything can be. Just a fantasy that happens to be set in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, admittedly, not your typical form of a fantasy, and this is a great part of its appeal. Though popular with many, the forms and trappings of fantasy are prone to clichés and can easily go stale. They can be off-putting to anyone outside of its most ardent fans. So while fantasy has the potential to be a vehicle for the myths our society needs to hear, it was very much not in vogue back in 1977. It no longer seemed relevant in a more pessimistic, post-Vietnam world. Movies were dark and bleak and gritty in this era, and only the nerds were reading Tolkien. It was, however, a world fascinated with the increasingly rapid pace of technology and of space travel. Globalization was arriving on the scene, and there were few places on earth left unexplored or mysterious, few places of fascination for the imagination. Space was the new unknown. Space had the possibility to excite wonder and hope even in the cynical 70s. By setting his fantasy in space, Lucas managed to take something very old and make it fresh and new, and to take something exciting and new and make it familiar and ancient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,” each movie begins, evoking fairy tales and folklore. This is simply the same “once upon a time in a kingdom far away” from any those stories, with the exception that this has its own special contradiction: it’s all happening in space, you see, but it’s also deep in the past. And it gets away with all this mythic and operatic pomposity because, anchoring the seriousness of the myth of the saga is the fact that the trilogy does not take itself overly seriously. There’s a relaxed camp, a sense of play, and of wonder, that lifts the story out of the mundane into the realm of myth and fable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogue One made a conscious decision not to be a space fantasy. Instead, it attempts to be a heist movie, or a war film, or some kind of hybrid of both, but definitely gritty, violent, ruthless and dirty. And perhaps the thing that most gets in the way of this movie being memorable or fun is the fact that it takes itself so very, very seriously. Yes, K2 had some good jokes. I actually smiled at them a few times. But the dry sarcasm of his humor only adds to rather than cuts against the general emotional flatness. And I even love dry sarcasm, as a rule. It’s humorless, sardonic, pessimistic humor in a humorless, sardonic, pessimistic movie. With no sense of play, the film maintains all the pomposity of Star Wars with none of the heart, camp, or wonder. Never mind that this means we have a movie that is monotonous and generally soulless in the way so many action movies are, but does this even work as a Star Wars film? Is Star Wars still itself outside of its home genre? Personally, I don’t think so, particularly when the movie in question is a direct prequel to the original movie that established that genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the mythic sensibility at the core of the fantasy genre, what’s left to define it as Star Wars at all? Just the outward forms, the details. Without the heart, there is only the minutiae — and the Star Wars universe now has a lot of minutiae: hundreds and hundreds of characters, planets, alien species, droids, backstories, spin-offs, you name it. I used to take a great amount of pride and enjoyment in soaking up all of this extended lore, so when I see a fan who lives for all those details, it feels familiar. I understand, I do. I remember when it felt like being a fan meant I needed not only more Star Wars, but better Star Wars, bigger, more spectacular, more epic, more sprawling, more detailed, more intricate. I wanted every single thing to be fleshed out and explained. Rogue One is popular with fans who feel this way because it rewards them with everything they want: more detail to absorb, and plenty of easter egg references to details they already know. It attempts to bring multiple strings of this sprawling Frankenstein that is the extended Star Wars universe lore into one movie and tie them all together. And if you love all those strings then this is a treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some fictional universes improve with a tight network of ever-increasing self-referential details and lore. I’ll discuss Game of Thrones minutiae with you all day, and happily. One of my favorite modern fantasy series, the dark and epic Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson, is satisfying and compelling because of its intensely detailed and self-referential nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading countless Extended Universe novels, comics, and spin-off materials in my time, I have come eventually to believe strongly that Star Wars is not like that. The more details you add, the more you explain, the more extra stuff you fold in, the further away you get from the realm of myth, the unique tone, the straightforward storytelling, and the fantasy genre at its core that gave the original films their distinctive character. You end up burying the originality of the trilogy under a mountain of junk that obscures its special quality. You end up with a lot of empty facts and data that are meaningless in and of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You end up with Rogue One, a movie that has all the Star Wars decorations but has as much to do in spirit with Star Wars as any Marvel or Star Trek movie does — that is to say, not much. It has in fact more in common with basically any action movie made in the last 10 years in any other franchise than it does with the movie for which it ostensibly serves as the direct prequel. Watching the two films back to back would be an exercise in absurdity, a jarring, janky roller-coaster ride. Though there is a narrative through-line, they could not be more different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not as though, by messing with the core essence of Star Wars that gave the originals their character, the filmmakers decided to do something entirely different but equally unique and interesting. If the argument is that we cannot re-hash the original trilogy, that Star Wars must evolve beyond those movies, then at least try to do something original and surprise me. If we strip away even the essential characteristics of Star Wars that I have laid out above, the general spirit of the franchise can be boiled down to creative audacity. There’s nothing bold or audacious about Rogue One. This is the same kind of action movie we’ve seen a million times in various forms, the one that is so focused on giving you an general wash of epic intensity and special effects to earn that opening weekend buzz that it gives you no substantial reason to watch it again and again (for me—sorry Lou). And it does it while wearing the costumes of a beloved franchise, expecting me to be automatically on board just because, you know, it’s Star Wars. So it’s no wonder that I felt faintly insulted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;IN CONCLUSION&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie simply doesn’t fit into the franchise. Or, even worse, it fits perfectly into a franchise that is increasingly unrecognizable from the films that launched it. Furthermore, it is mediocre and unimaginative. I could forgive mediocre, I guess, because most movies like it are mediocre. But unimaginative is unforgivable. Star Wars deserves better. Star Wars has already suffered enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Rogue One suggests I am in the minority in this opinion. It’s box office and critical success, in addition to how much it has won over some of my fellow die-hard fans, suggests a future for the franchise that worries me. If this is really the kind of Star Wars movie we want, then this is the kind of Star Wars movie that Disney is going to keep giving us. And then the franchise, which has already been slowly dying for decades, will finally collapse under the weight of its own cultural cache into self-referential drudgery and narrative mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may simply have to come to terms with this. Movies are not made to accommodate my particular sensibilities, after all. And maybe it’s just plain ridiculous that all this bothers me at all. Look at everything that’s going on in the world! Why do I care about this so much? I mean, they are just movies, right? Why bother writing a huge essay like this to argue about some silly movies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if you are a true fan, you know that they are more than that. They are the myths through which I subconsciously processed my own journey to adulthood. They are the allegories through which I came to understand the humanity of my enemies. And that is worth arguing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, at least I have the original trilogy, no matter what the future brings to the franchise. It’s not like George Lucas is gonna go back and mess with those and ruin them or anything, right?&lt;/p&gt;
